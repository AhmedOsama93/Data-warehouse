# Data-warehouse
in this project, we built a data warehouse on formula 1 data
## the 1st step is getting the data(formula 1) from kaggel https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020
* The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, 
qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, and championships from 1950 till the latest 2021 
season and represent it in ERD.

## the 2nd step is creating a star schema in this data
* we set some goals and start to create a star schema according to these goals.we select important dimensions and work on them and write SQL quires that achieve this star schema in our data.

## the 3rd step is creating a cube in this data
* we use VS code and analysis services in SQL management studio and write some MDX quries in this cube.

## the 4th step is an analysis 
* We analyzed this cube using python(NumPy and pandas) and excel.
